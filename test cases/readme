Folder and File Structure in the Root Directory
Assuming you want to have test files structured in a specific way for your app's Playwright tests, your directory layout should look like this:

```sh 
/my-app-root-directory
  ├── /tests                          # Folder to store all end-to-end (E2E) tests
  │     ├── credentials-auth.spec.ts  # Playwright test for  authentication
  │     └── client.spec.ts            # Playwright test for client
  ├── package.json                    # Node.js dependencies and scripts
  ├── playwright.config.ts            # Configuration file for Playwright
  └── /src                            # Your application's source code
